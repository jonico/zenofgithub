# zenofgithub - how to consume portable [conan.io](https://www.conan.io/) C/C++ packages, like [libzengithub](https://github.com/jonico/libzengithub), [libgit2](https://github.com/paulobrizolara/libgit2-conan) and [libcurl](https://github.com/lasote/conan-libcurl)

```zenofgithub``` is a small C application that prints out a random [Zen of Github](http://ben.balter.com/2015/08/12/the-zen-of-github/) whenever you call it from a directory that contains a Git repository:

```
./zenofgithub
```

will provide you something like

```
               MMM.           .MMM
               MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
               MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM      _________________________________________
              MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM    |                                         |
             MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   | Anything added dilutes everything else. |
            MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   |_   _____________________________________|
            MMMM::- -:::::::- -::MMMM    |/
             MM~:~ 00~:::::~ 00~:~MM
        .. MMMMM::.00:::+:::.00::MMMMM ..
              .MM::::: ._. :::::MM.
                 MMMM;:::::;MMMM
          -MM        MMMMMMM
          ^  M+     MMMMMMMMM
              MMMMMMM MM MM MM
                   MM MM MM MM
                   MM MM MM MM
                .~~MM~MM~MM~MM~~.
             ~~~~MM:~MM~~~MM~:MM~~~~
            ~~~~~~==~==~~~==~==~~~~~~
             ~~~~~~==~==~==~==~~~~~~
                 :~==~==~==~==~~
```

if you are in a Git repo and

```
You're not in a git repo so the octocat will stay silent.
Create a git repo and the Zen of GitHub will be revealed to you.
```

if you are not in a Git repo.

# But why?

The main purpose of this application is to demo how you can use the portable [conan.io](https://www.conan.io/) package manager to declare (and easily consume) C/C++ dependencies no matter whether you are running on Windows, Linux or Mac.

This small demo application consumes a lot of packages, like [ZenGithub](https://github.com/jonico/libzengithub), [libgit2](https://github.com/paulobrizolara/libgit2-conan), [libbzip2](https://github.com/lasote/conan-bzip2) and their transitive dependencies:

```
conan info . --graph deps.html
open deps.html
```

The only thing to consume all those dependencies is to have a [conanfile.txt](https://github.com/jonico/zenofgithub/blob/master/conanfile.txt) which is referencing the versions you want:

```
[requires]
ZenGitHub/1.0@jonico/stable
libgit2/0.24.2@paulobrizolara/stable
bzip2/1.0.6@lasote/stable
```

conan.io takes care of the rest, downloads the dependencies from your conan.io remotes and if it cannot find appropriate binaries for your architecture, download the build recipe and build locally.

# Building the package

## Basic setup

First, [install](http://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html) the conan package manager locally.
Then, add the remote to my conan bintray repo where the [ZenGithub](https://github.com/jonico/libzengithub) package is stored:

```
conan remote add conan-jonico https://api.bintray.com/conan/conan-jonico/libzengithub
```

Then, clone this repository and cd into it:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonico/zenofgithub.git && cd zenofgithub
```

After that, create a build subdirectory and cd into it:

```
mkdir build && cd build
```

## Installing dependent conan packages

Now you can let conan do the work and install all needed dependencies and generates the files *conanbuildinfo.txt* and *conanbuildinfo.cmake* with all the paths and variables that we need to link with our dependencies.

`
conan install ..
`

If conan complains about missing dependencies (like ZenGitHub, libCurl or libz or OpenSSL), this is an indication that we do not have a pre-built version of those packages for your architecture. Don't worry, this is how you can build anything missing on your local machine instead:

```
conan install .. --build missing
```

If you rather want to link statically against libcurl (or other libraries), run

```
conan install .. -o libcurl:shared=False --build missing
```

## Generating Makefile, compile and link

Now, that all dependencies are satisfied and *conanbuildinfo.txt* and *conanbuildinfo.cmake* are generated, we just have to create the Makefile using cmake (or any other [generator](http://conanio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generators.html?highlight=generator) of your choice).

For Linux and Mac, run

```
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

For Windows, run

```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64"
cmake --build . --config Release
```

After that, you can finally run our small program:

```
cd bin
./zenofgithub
```

If the :octocat: does not reveal a Zen of GitHub yet, you have to switch to a Git repo or create one:

```
git init
./zenofgithub

               MMM.           .MMM
               MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
               MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM      _______________________________________
              MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM    |                                       |
             MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   | Non-blocking is better than blocking. |
            MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM   |_   ___________________________________|
            MMMM::- -:::::::- -::MMMM    |/
             MM~:~ 00~:::::~ 00~:~MM
        .. MMMMM::.00:::+:::.00::MMMMM ..
              .MM::::: ._. :::::MM.
                 MMMM;:::::;MMMM
          -MM        MMMMMMM
          ^  M+     MMMMMMMMM
              MMMMMMM MM MM MM
                   MM MM MM MM
                   MM MM MM MM
                .~~MM~MM~MM~MM~~.
             ~~~~MM:~MM~~~MM~:MM~~~~
            ~~~~~~==~==~~~==~==~~~~~~
             ~~~~~~==~==~==~==~~~~~~
                 :~==~==~==~==~~
```

Enjoy :octocat::heart:
